inspired by flashcard systems (an effective way to memorize facts).

In any case, the webapp has a quiz mode and an edit mode.  In the quiz
mode, you can hit "space" or click the mouse, and it'll show you the
location associated with the picture.  Then you click yes or no, or
hit "Y" or "N", and it records your success on that picture.

The edit mode allows you to view and edit all the pictures as well as
the success stats on these pictures. You can also upload pictures to
your instance of the app.
